                    <h1> My Story</h1>
                    <p>This life story of hardship and challenges meets weird illustrations and wacky animations. I used to be a “hood rat”, living my life tagging buildings (basically graffitiing buildings) and getting myself into trouble. I was arrested my sophomore year. The police officer walked me to the front of my house at 3:00am to exploit my shameful acts in front of my parents. It worked. I saw my mom cry for the first time. Her eyes were filled with shame and disappointment. I decided that I didn’t want to be some low-life loser any longer. I moved to a charter school with strict uniform regulations because it was arguably the best school in my area; however, I did not utilize it to its fullest potential and by my senior year, I was rejected from every school I applied to.<br><br>

	I thought to myself, “who is the most successful person in my family and is it possible to live under them so that I can provide myself a better life?” My mom’s family was no help because most of them were living in poverty in the Philippines and my Father was a 86 year old man at that time. However, I did find one distant relative that would let me live with them in the LA area. It was my chance! However, life was bananas. I had to struggle for three years. I biked to my job and then biked to my school everyday. That totaled to 30 miles a week on my bike.<br><br>

After a year, I saved up enough money to buy that 1998 rav4. It was ideally supposed to help me get place to place and be able to pack all my stuff and move to downtown LA, but it didn’t last the life expectancy that I was hoping for. It became a money pit and I ended up selling so that it no longer became an expense. After moving all my stuff, I lived with a godmother for several months until I was kicked out because the landlady found out I was living there for free. That apartment was bed-bug infested, but I would have chosen that then living on a cold cement floor. The next thing I knew, I was homeless. I couldn’t ask my family for help because I moved out to prove a point and not affect my parents financially. It was hard. Sometimes I really thought of just giving up. I cried. I weeped. Until, I built up the courage to ask a friend that I wasn’t close with to live with his family for a couple of months. Never will I forget all the people that have helped me get to this point. I still didn’t have the best gpa in community college, but I got into my dream school -- UC Berkeley. I am writing this story to motivate those who need it (me being one of them lol). After Covid-19 hit, I have lost a lot of my motivation. I used to reach for the stars when times were tough and I always had a plan. Now, I feel lost. Like the time I was homeless and I had no idea where to turn to, except this time it's in my own self doubt and insecurities. I hope whoever is reading this knows that when life gets bananas. It’s okay to feel how you are feeling. Sometimes we don’t even know why we are feeling a certain way and we wallow around. In those times, that is when we have to be the kindest to ourselves. I’ve always wanted to be something. Something that people could look up to. Something that could inspire and motivate others to achieve their goals. I am still by far nowhere near my goals and I can definitely be lazy some days, but always remember where you started and keep pushing forward. Moral of the story, don’t forget where you started and whenever you hit a wall don't be afraid to seek help.
